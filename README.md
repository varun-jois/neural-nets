# neural-nets
The purpose of this repository was to improve my understanding of neural networks and how backpropagation works. I have created an implementation of a neural network class in the file NeuralNet.py. This class is used to create neural networks for the MNIST dataset and it is demonstrated in the jupyter notebook titled "Multiclass Classification with the MNIST dataset.ipynb". For binary classification, I have used a neural network to predict positive movie reviews. The analysis can be found in "Binary classification of movie reviews.ipynb".
